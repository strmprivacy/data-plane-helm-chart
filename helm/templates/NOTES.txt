Successfully installed STRM Privacy Data Plane. In order to use the CLI with the simulate and listen commands,
we recommend to use a configuration file. See https://github.com/strmprivacy/cli/#configuration for more information.

Please note that this either requires a kubectl port forward, or a VPN (i.e. https://www.telepresence.io/) to your
Kubernetes cluster to properly work.

If you use the included Kafka, Redis, and/or Postgres deployments, please note that it may take a few moments for
everything to be up and running. Note that these deployments are NOT meant for production purposes.
